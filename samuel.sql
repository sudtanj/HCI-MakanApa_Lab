If you can''t find them in your area, substitute bottled Key lime juice. We''ve tried several different brands in our test kitchens, and prefer the taste of Manhattan.* This recipe is modified from the classic one found on many condensed milk and Key lime juice labels; we''ve added additional lime juice for more tartness.','Make crust:

    Preheat oven to 350°F.
    Stir together graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and butter in a bowl with a fork until combined well, then press mixture evenly onto bottom and up side of a 9-inch (4-cup) glass pie plate.
    Bake crust in middle of oven 10 minutes and cool in pie plate on a rack. Leave oven on. 

Make filling and bake pie:

    Whisk together condensed milk and yolks in a bowl until combined well. Add juice and whisk until combined well (mixture will thicken slightly).
    Pour filling into crust and bake in middle of oven 15 minutes. Cool pie completely on rack (filling will set as it cools), then chill, covered, at least 8 hours. 

Make topping:

    Just before serving, beat cream in a bowl with an electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks. Serve pie topped with cream. ','http://mock.robotemplates.com/cookbook/key.jpg','',70,5,300,0),

 (6,'Summer Salad With Tomatoes and Basil','This salad is an absolute winner.  It''s so easy to make.  It''s so light and refreshing.  It tastes like summer!  Like others have said, it can be modified- I like to put sliced red onion in it- but it tastes great as is too.  I serve it alone, on top of flatbread or on top of baguette rounds.  And it''s a perfect addition to BBQs to give an alternative to the heavy, mayo-based salads. Love it!','Step 1
    In a small skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and stir, lightly frying for about a minute and removing from the heat before the garlic gets too brown (it can be golden). 

Step 2
    Pour it into a mixing bowl and allow to cool slightly. Add the tomatoes, balsamic, basil and some salt and pepper to the bowl.

    Prepare the marinade for the tuna by whisking together soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Place tuna steaks in a Ziploc bag and pour in marinade. Coat well and place in your refrigerator.

Sear the tuna:

Step 1

    Remove tuna steaks from pan and thinly slice into approximately 1-inch pieces.

Prepare the nachos:

Step 1
    Assemble nachos by evenly distributing fried wontons onto 2 plates. Top each with ½ of the seaweed salad, followed by the sliced tuna, avocado, tomatoes and sesame seeds.
